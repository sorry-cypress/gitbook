**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1

## 2.0.0 🎉

### Breaking changes

* Deprecated support for cypress agents lt `6.7.0`
  * Supporting the legacy versions of cypress with all the code was cumbersome. Trying to use SC with older cypress versions would return an error when creating new runs. Closes #412.
* The internal representation of runs has changed. **Runs created prior to v2.0 might be displayed partially or not displayed at all.**
  * added a `progress` field on `run` with the instances and tests progress state. We use this field to report run's progress in hooks / dashboard instead of invoking complex MongoDB queries. This should resolve #417 because we won't use MongoDB aggregations that create gt 16MB documents.
  * `runs.specs` will have a short version of "results" - that would allow more efficient data fetching for showing runs feeds and individual runs.

### Other changes

* feat: 😎 ⭐️ New UI implementation by @ImanMahmoudinasab
* fix: Delete run timeout when deleting run. Closes #409.
* fix: Correctly report failed tests w/o counting retires. Closes #384
* fix: In-memory director crashes when test fails with an exception. Closes #425
* fix: Stop showing duration running for completed runs / tests. Closes #377
* feat: Add retries to Slack integration, show retries count everywhere and use "Flaky" badge if spec / test was retried. Closes #378
* feat: Configure default page items # on runs feed via `PAGE_ITEMS_LIMIT` env variable for API service
* infra: remove redis dependency in docker-compose files, updated docs accordingly
* infra: properly set up typescript for monorepo, resolved dozens of TS errors and warnings
* misc: completely removed lookup aggregations from mongoDB queries. Sorry cypress is much DocumentDB friendly now!
* misc: added material-UI for gradual transition. See #401
