### Start Using Managed Cypress Tests Dashboard

We've recently launched [https://currents.dev](https://currents.dev/cypress-to-playwright?utm_source=docs-sc) - a managed cypress tests dashboard, which is based on sorry-cypress. By using currents.dev you're supporting sorry-cypress:

* we port features and improvements between projects
* we have resources to hire developers for help
* we are able to invest more time into the project

Thank you!
