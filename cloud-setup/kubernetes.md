There is a Helm chart for Sorry Cypress. Detailed information on the latest release versions plus how to install and configure can be found at [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress).

The chart is designed to work with Kubernetes 1.16 to 1.27.

If you find any issues with the Helm chart, or you wish to raise a feature request, please raise an issue in the [Sorry Cypress Charts Git repository](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/charts/issues).
