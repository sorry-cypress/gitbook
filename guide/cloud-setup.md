# Cloud Setup

### Cloud Demo

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

Visit [https://sorry-cypress-demo.herokuapp.com/](https://sorry-cypress-demo.herokuapp.com/) to see the web dashboard in action.

Start sending your cypress tests to the demo dashboard by using the following command:

```

```

### Cloud Providers

Now you can consider deploying it on your own infrastructure.
