  Running the full sorry-cypress kit - setting up web dashboard to store and
  browse test results

# Dashboard and API

The [basic](get-started.md) setup of sorry-cypress is already quite useful - we can run cypress tests in parallel without any limitations.

However, we want to store and see the test results, explore errors, screenshots and videos.

### Running sorry-cypress kit <a id="persisting-test-results"></a>

We are going to run the full sorry-cypress kit:

1. `director` service will use MongoDB to store the test runs and the results
2. `API` service \(a GraphQL interface to MongoDB\) to let us issue queries and retrieve tests results
3. `Dashboard` service - a web dashboard for browsing the results
4. [`minio`](https://min.io/product/overview)  will let us store files - videos and screenshots generated by cypress agent

We are going to run all the services locally using `docker-compose`

```bash
# get docker-compose file
curl --output docker-compose.minio.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sorry-cypress/sorry-cypress/master/docker-compose.minio.yml

# start the services
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.minio.yml up
```

{% hint style="info" %}
* Make sure to install a modern version of [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Shut down any stale sorry-cypress services with `docker kill`
{% endhint %}

After successfully running docker-compose, we have:

* `director` service on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)
* `API` service on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)  
* `Dashboard` running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Open the dashboard at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Setup Screenshots Upload

We are using `minio` service to store file generated by cypress agents - video recordings and failed tests screenshots. Each agent uploads the files directly to `minio` . 

Edit your `/etc/hosts` file to allow cypress agents to discover the local instance of `minio`

```bash
127.0.0.1 storage
```

### Running cypress tests in parallel. <a id="running-cypress-tests-in-parallel"></a>

`director` is running in a Docker container, but it is still accessible at [`http://localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234). We have already reconfigured `cypress` to use this URL. Let's just rerun the tests.

Open several terminal windows within a directory with tests and run `cypress` in each.

```bash
# run in each terminal
cypress run --parallel --record --key somekey --ci-build-id hello-cypress
```

As soon as agents start their execution, refresh the dashboard. You'd see a new project and a new run created.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use the same `--ci-build-id` value to associate different cypress agents with the same run. 
{% endhint %}

### Exploring the dashboard

The dashboard is quite simple - go ahead and explore the tests you have just created.

Congratulations 🎉  

You have set up sorry-cypress on your local machine. Now you can run unlimited cypress tests and use the dashboard to browse the results.

In the next article, we'll learn how to setup sorry-cypress in the cloud using different cloud providers.
